Core Java Evaluation

Design Approach:
----------------
I will create client and server two application using socket programming and will store random numbers in priority blocking queue and will sent this queue to prime
job for processing and will display prime no's.

Sample Output:
--------------
Insert Rantdom Integer: 3
3 is prime no

Better Improvement:
-------------------
I will try to do incorporate JMS concept queue and topic will insert random numbers for processing from topic to idenfify prime no or not.
Using spring boot we will create a job schedular for processing.
Hazile Cast distribute configuration as an other approach.
